 # Hello Results
 
 The `Result` type bridges the world of error handling with the ergonomics that you would get from using the `Optional<Wrapped>`
 type. The `Result` type is quite similar to the `Optional<Wrapped>` in that it's an enum with two cases, but it has a few
 important differences that distinguishes itself.
 
 ___
 ## What is it?
 
 ### - Inside the Standard Library with `Result`
 
 Again the Result is a pretty simple type. Here's the implementation straight from the Swift Open Source project. You can find this in the
 Standard Library (Path: swift/stdlib/public/core/Result.swift).

 The `Result<Success, Failure>` helps us to logically model scenarios where we are attempting to accomplish a task that can
 either succeed or fail. Similarly to the Optional type, you can think of these cases like paths that a given situation can travel through.
 There's a success path and a failure path.
 
 You may have noticed though, that there are two generic paramters on this type. The Success represents any value that you'd like to pass
 in a successful situation. The Failure is something that conforms to the `Swift.Error` protocol and is passed in the event that the
 scenario is not successful.
 
 ___
 ## What's it do for us?
 
 ### - Let's walk though the scenarios with the Result type
 If you remember the `func doublesASingle(digit: Int) -> Int?`, let's try to reimplement it with the `Result` type.

//: You can extract the value by using patern matching





//: You can also extract it by traditional error handling





//: Composable? Not quite yet! We'll get there üëç

 ## Operating along the path
 
 The `Result<Success, Error>` type is also a monadic type and has the `map` and `flatMap` operators. Again, these operators
 allows us to operate on the happy path of the type.
 
 ### - Inside the Standard Library with `map`
 ![Result map Swift Standard Lib](ResultMap.png "Swift Result Map Implementation")
 
 The map operator provided by the `Result<Success, Error>` has all the same, faliliar ability provided to us by the `Optional`
 type.
 ### - Result.map in motion
 
 Let's see a couple of simple and side-effecty examples with map

//: What about our gated doubler? Will that also work with Result?





/*:
 
 ### - Inside the Standard Library with `flatMap`
 Nothing new here. Just another plain old `.flatMap` on another monadic type üòÉ

 ### - Result.flatMap in motion

 ## Operating on the "other" path?
 What's all this I keep seeing about `.mapError` and `.flatMapError`? I didn't see these on the `Optional<Wrapped>` type!
 Well, those my friend give us the power to work some magic when erorrs occur. The generic error parameter in the
 `Result<Success, Error>` gives us these extra powers that we didn't have with the optional type.
 
 Ultimately, they do the same exact thing as their normal counterparts except that:
 
 1 - Their transforms are only called when an error occur
 
 2 - The value they operate on is the error value
 
 ### - Result.mapError in motion
 
 First, we'll need a new error type to work with.
 */







//: `.mapError` helps with converting a cought error into another error type





/*:
 ### - Result.flatMapError in motion
 
 `.flatMapError` intercepts an error and returns a new Result type. This is very powerful and can even facilitate error recovery for
 more robust API's.
 */





/*:
 Now that you've probably got a good feel for Results, let's take a look a few more advanced usecases/examples.
